It's a fake Pokémon GTS server.
rs-sendpkm-bw.py is a modificated version of ir-gts-bw'sendpkm.py <http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/>.
To install, just copy `sendpkm.py` and `shifter.py` on /ir-gts-bw/src/.
Tested only on ir-gts-bw 0.05 <http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/>.

Feature added (rs-sendpkm-bw.py):
	Giving a path, rs-sendpkm-bw gives casually one of the .pkm files which are in the directory at the game;
	Otherwise of kill himself, when it gives a Pokémon at the game, rs-sendpkm-bw waits another game to gives it another Pokémon, while it isn't killed;
	A couple of rows to optimize the code;
	Each 4°gen Pokémon is shifted to 5°gen.
